Sure! Here’s the revised explanation without the summary table:

How Debugging Is a Search Process

Debugging is like solving a mystery — you’re tracing through symptoms (like incorrect output or errors) to identify the root cause. You form hypotheses, test them, eliminate false leads, and gradually hone in on the bug. It’s a methodical search through code, logic, and assumptions.

PRAGMATIC Debugging Techniques (from Section 8.2.3)

1. Look for the usual suspects

Start by checking for common errors.

Example:

def multiply(a, b):
    return a + b  # Should be a * b

result = multiply(3, 4)
print(result)  # Output: 7

Bug: Used + instead of *.

⸻

2. Stop asking why the program isn’t doing what you want. Ask why it is doing what it is.

Focus on what the program is actually doing.

Example:

items = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(items[4])  # IndexError

Bug: Trying to access an index that doesn’t exist. Reframing the question leads to discovering it’s an off-by-one error.

⸻

3. The bug is probably not where you think it is

Widen your search. The error may come from earlier in the code.

Example:

def calculate_area(length, width):
    return length * width

area = calculate_area(5, 0)
print("Area is:", area)

Bug: The width is 0, possibly assigned incorrectly elsewhere — not inside calculate_area.

⸻

4. Try to explain the problem to somebody else

Verbalizing the issue helps uncover incorrect logic.

Example:

def is_even(n):
    return n % 2 == 1  # Actually checks for odd

print(is_even(4))  # False

Bug: You realize your logic is reversed once you try to explain it.

⸻

5. Don’t believe everything you read

Trust the code, not necessarily the comments or docs.

Example:

# This function squares a number
def square(n):
    return n ** 3  # Actually cubes it

print(square(2))  # Output: 8

Bug: Documentation is misleading; the actual code is incorrect.

6. Stop debugging and start writing documentation

Describing how code works often uncovers logic errors.

Example:

def add_list(lst):
    total = 0
    for val in lst:
        total += val
    return total

result = add_list(["1", "2"])

Bug: List contains strings; writing documentation would prompt a type check.

7. Walk away and try again tomorrow

A fresh mind can catch what a tired one misses.

Example:

def subtract(a, b):
    return a + b  # Obvious logic mistake

print(subtract(5, 2))  # Output: 7

Bug: Clear after taking a break — wrong operator used.
